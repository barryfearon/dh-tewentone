            <p>
              The Dark Horse Isle of Man Music Festival is all about celebrating the Isle of Man
              music festival, arts and culture scene and is now in it’s fourth year. We plan to
              improve the event year on year by offering: days of music, camping and good company,
              along with activities, workshops and stalls for the mind, body, soul, eardrums and
              taste buds.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s <b>happening </b>over the weekend of July 19, 20, 21, at the same beautiful
              location –{' '}

              The resident cows have kindly agreed to vacate their barn for us to transform into the
              festival’s main music stage, while the surrounding fields (as well as housing our
              campsites) will be alive with local food producers, artists, teachers and musicians
              sharing what they do.

              The Dark Horse Music team have&nbsp;experience in organising Manx live events since
              2008. During this time Dark Horse Music&nbsp;have hosted many successful Isle of Man
              music festival gigs with&nbsp;top UK festival acts. With help from other musicians and
              friends, we want this festival to be something that brings together community people,
              doing good things!
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, we’re excited. However we also believe – to keep our feet on the ground
              &nbsp;– that modesty is the best policy. We are slowly growing the event but not in a
              way that is unsustainable. So if you bring yourselves, your friends, a tent and your
              ticket… we’ll sort out the folk; the funk; the soul; the strings; the beats; the
              decorations; the campfire and everything else in our power to make it a very special
              time.
