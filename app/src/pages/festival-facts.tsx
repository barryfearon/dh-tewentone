              <li>If you bring a campervan it must remain on site until the Sunday</li>
              <li>
                We have a strict quiet / family camping area with no noise after 1am or face
                ejection!

              <li>
                Do not bring glass onto the site….it's a working farm so think of the cow's feet!

              <li>Bring ID or no entry</li>
              <li>Lost wristband means no more festival…KEEP THEM ON</li>
              <li>
                There will be food vendors but small BBQs are permitted if kept off the ground(if
                the summer is too dry we may revoke this)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Look out for each other and respect the environment. If you decide to leave all your
              tents/chairs/bedding and litter we will ban you from subsequent events!! So we thank
              you, in advance for keeping the site clean 🙂 We advise you read our terms and
              conditions before you attend the festival.
